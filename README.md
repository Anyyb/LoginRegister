As a group project in school we had an assignment to do Web application that uses server side. 
I initilized the application with Express to work, I followed MVC design pattern. 
The app is not public since it was a group project for school and I did login and register.
I created the Login and Register page with MongoDB database connection to create and read users.
I added the pictures of these final projects.
